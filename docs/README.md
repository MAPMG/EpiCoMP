# EpiCoMP Tutorials

This folder contains two tutorial notebooks that introduce users to the interfaces used to construct Particles and then Filter them.

**PLEASE NOTE:** We have observed that GitHub can sometimes have difficulties rendering these notebooks in the browser.  To work around this issue, we recommend either
downloading the notebooks and viewing them locally using your choice of notebook viewwer or using a more consistent online renderer such as [this one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
